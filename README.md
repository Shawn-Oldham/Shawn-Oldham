## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I am the newest hubber member of the Technical Risk team.
### I report to Crystal Altidor.
###  
### I am a dedicated Third Party Risk Analyst who thrives on the challenges of my role. For me, being a third party risk analyst is a perfect blend of analytical and  investigative work. I love diving into research and piecing together a comprehensive view of vendors, ensuring that all aspects are thoroughly examined and understood.
### In addition to my professional pursuits, 
###
### I have a passion for reading fantasy and science fiction. Recently, I have delved into several series that explore the intriguing and thought-provoking theme of societal collapse in the United States, particularly focusing on scenarios where the power grid goes down for an extended period of at least a year.
###
### I also enjoy playing the online strategy game Star Trek Fleet Command, where I find excitement and challenge in strategizing and exploring the vast universe of Star Trek.
###
### My personal life is enriched by my family, including my wife, mother-in-law, and our beloved dog, Olee. I am an avid sports fan, particularly enjoying college basketball and college football. My favorite team is the University of Kentucky Wildcats, and I never miss an opportunity to cheer them on.
